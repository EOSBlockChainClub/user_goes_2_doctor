Fuzi project

EOS Hackathon London 2018

Companies sometimes require sensitive data and blockchain is an immutable ledger making it at first glance unnerving to users who want to protect their data in this time when societies are becoming increasingly aware of the risks involved with their data security.  On the contrary, blockchain has the power to empower the owners to control exactly who gains access to which data by combining it with trusted computing storage and encrypting the data with blockchain technology.  Often the information that you give doesnâ€™t have to be specific, it only has to fit within specific criteria.  We call this fuzzy data.  The data owner does not have to disclose his data fully, but only provides an answer if he matches conditions set by the service provider or/and the law.
